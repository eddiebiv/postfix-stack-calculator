# postfix-stack-calculator

This program computes postfix arithmetic using a stack. The operands and operators are
 entered by the user and are individually checked. If an operand is detected, the value
 is pushed into a stack. If an operator is detected, the stack is popped twice and the program
 jumps to the subroutine associated with the entered operator. This continues as long as
 values are entered. The result is printed to the screen if the top of the stack ends
 pointing at the start of the stack, indicating an empty stack.
